# JS Calculator

This project is meant as a demonstration of skills and knowledge from WidesðŸŽ¸, the self taught developer, mediocre philosopher, ugly bard, and village idiot... I did use a tutorial by Web Dev Simplified, <https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified>, to get going with this originally. I have since came behind, added funtionality not covered in the tutorial and attempted to add rather than simply copy. There's a lot of his design theory and direction within for obvious reasons. I wouldn't count this as fully original but a decent demo of skills for sure!

Within this quick project is a fully funtional simple calculator written in Javascript. This can be useful technically but I don't expect anyone to use this compared to the thousands of better options. However this is useful as a demo of my coding ability and the concepts I understand, specifically OOP which is the foundational design on display here.

I hope this project is well received. Let me know what you think!
